# Neutralino Vite React Template

This **Neutralino.js** template employes **Vite**, **TypeScript**, **React**, and **Chakra UI**. It provides a lightweight, cross-platform desktop application setup using modern web development tools.

## Features

- **Neutralino.js**: Build cross-platform desktop apps with a lightweight footprint.
- **Vite**: Lightning-fast bundler and development environment.
- **React**: Popular library for building interactive user interfaces.
- **Chakra UI**: Modular and accessible component library for React.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the project:**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/maverickg59/neutralino-vrc.git
   ```

2. **Initialize the project:**:

   ```bash
   npm run setup
   ```

   Setup runs a build script that installs Neutralino globally, runs npm install, and runs the app in dev. Feel free to handle this manually if you like.

## Project Structure

- **/app**: React source code

- **/scripts**: Setup script and home for other scripts you might build
- **neutralino.config.json**: Neutralino config

This template is ideal for developers looking to quickly set up a desktop app using familiar web technologies.

### TODO:
